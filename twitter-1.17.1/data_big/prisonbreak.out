lmao sarah's face when she saw owen
who knew that freddie mercury would be mentioned in that's class @ prisonbreak @ queenwillrock @ foxtvuk michaelscofield
kellerman seems like a dodgy guy again
absolutely loving the new season but it's not the very last one i'd even start a campaign to keep it going with more episodes

forever wishing i was as cleaver as michael scofield
omg what all new episodes i can't wait
have such high hopes that this revival of @ prisonbreak is going to be awesome tvaddict
it's so mad lol years later but they all look the same they haven't really aged
being back honestly makes mondays soooooo much better
i'm so confused who did this to michael
sara just walking away from paul though
kaniel has taken micheal identiy this isent good on his part hows he gonna get out they ill think hes a killer
brand new continues right now on @ foxtvuk starring the incredibly talented @ augustusprew seen here
when sarah sees the video and realises that michael is alive
another episode of pb that didn't disappoint brilliant start to series 5
when you think you worked out michael's plans and then
i still have no idea what's going on
what the heck can't we see next weeks straight away
michael's cellmate when he saw him hug the terrorist
the arrggghh is it next monday yet @ daleb1234 @ foxtvuk
is insane what is going on kanieloutis
so michael is part of the terrorist group allegedly
cracking episode of prison break good to see paul kellerman back
yo michael what are you doing
michael part of isis or what
i was so happy to see kellerman
my face at the end of that episode
what has micheal got up his sleeve i wonder
i didn't understand that ending
this is why i hate watching tv series on tv having to wait a week for the next episode is just long
me knowing an all new is on tomorrow @ prisonbreak
i'm am totally obsessed with i'm so glad they brought it back
having to wait another week for the next episode is painful
there friends soooo confused
michael scofield might just be one of the greatest tv characters ever @ foxtvuk
i've just watched s04e04 prison break
prison breaks got me on edge sooo good
seems like a lot of trouble to send an origami flower
hid everyone a storm is coming i wonder who that pizza man was then
loving having back on tv great episode @ foxtvuk
michael got himself beat up just so he could project his wife and child
we thought we lost another michael
hooked on the fantastic @ prisonbreak while some seasons were stronger than others it's always an edge of the seat thrill
seconded loving new gripping intense and exciting
that proves that even though you have a big machine gun dosent mean you wont get killed
michael schofield is such a genius omg i have missed this
now that's the lincoln i love
that was difficult to watch scofield getting the beating of his life
i've just watched episode s05e02 of prison break
the new @ prisonbreak is just as intense as the original
what better way to spend a monday night than with a glass of wine and perfect waited a long time for this
